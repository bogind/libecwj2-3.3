## Getting and installing GDAL 2.2.2
```
$ wget -c http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/2.2.2/gdal-2.2.2.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf gdal-2.2.2.tar.gz
$ cd gdal-2.2.2
```
**NOTE** I recommend configuring and installing with java bindings as well curl, postgres, python and spatialite.
If you only want ECW support you can drop all the other flags after it.
As for the java bindings, these worked best for me with java-8-oracle and not with openjdk
```
# ./configure --with-ecw=/usr/local --with-python --with-spatialite --with-pg --with-curl --with-java=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle --with-jvm-lib=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/amd64/server --with-jvm-lib-add-rpath=yes
```
Make sure you see ECW support marked as yes on the list
```
# sudo make
# sudo make install
```
After dinishing this you need to set the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables so that GDAL could recognise the location of the ECW library (bu default /usr/local/lib).
The easiest way i found to doing this is:
```
# echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib' >> ~/.profile
# echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib' >> ~/.bashrc
sudo ldconfig
```
Add the following rows to `/etc/enviroment`
```
GDAL_DATA="/usr/local/share/gdal"
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games"
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle"
```

# Testing the installation was succefull
on Linux open a terminal
```
gdalinfo --formats | grep ECW
```
On Windows open CMD
```
gdalinfo --formats | findstr ECW
```
# Installing GDAL with ECW support on windows
## Tested on windows 10 and 7

This is much easier as there are packaged versions you can get from [gisinternals](https://www.gisinternals.com/archive.php)

Download a zipped GDAL copy, 
for example [release-1911-x64-gdal-2-4-0-mapserver-7-2-1](https://www.gisinternals.com/query.html?content=filelist&file=release-1911-x64-gdal-2-4-0-mapserver-7-2-1.zip) which is the latest release right now.  
unzip its content and place the contents of its `bin\gdal\apps` and `bin\gdal\plugins`,`bin\gdal\plugins in `C:\Program Files\GDAL`.
also place the contents of `bin\gdal-data` in `C:\Program Files\GDAL\Data`.
